### Systematization ##

It follows from the rational that the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

 * Plataforma
 * Organizacao
 * Colaborador
 * EnderecoPostal


Outras classes de software (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identificadas:

 * AnalysisFreelancerUI
 * AnalysisFreelancerController
