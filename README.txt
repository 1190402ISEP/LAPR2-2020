**LAPR2_2020_G038 REPOSITORY**

* PRODUCT: Generate Payments API

**What is the product you have to develop?**

The main goal of this project is to develop an application that allows organizations to make and manage payments to freelancers. More over, the application should enable the T4J administrator to monitor both the payments made by the organizations and the performance of the freelancers.

**What is its purpose?**

The application should allow the collaborator of the organization to create payment transactions for each finished/executed task the collaborator should introduce a brief description of the task. So, it's about how many transactions can be made and how these should be controlled for the respective payments and to supervise all of them.

**How it works?**

Initially, it will be necessary to have an Organization responsible for this information. If it does not exist, then it will be necessary to register one, hence the origin of UC2. The one responsible for this instance will be the Administrator, the person responsible for generating the first use of the application, thus making the first login to it.
Then, the Administrator must register a Manager and an Organization Collaborator, both registered as Users and responsible for statistical assessments and also for payment transactions to workers.
These workers are designated as Freelancers who submit an application to perform certain tasks, which were first designated by the Organization's Collaborator.
To perform a task, the Freelancer needs to have a minimum of skills to do so. Being duly valid to proceed, this will then be registered on the Platform and will be assigned a Login. The Employee performs the proper registration of the Freelancer.
Each task performed, has some rules to be evaluated: it is based on the deadline, delivery delay and quality of work that the Manager will assess the real performance of that work, to calculate the amount to be paid.
Thus, the Collaborator proceeds with the payment transaction to Freelancer, who will also receive an email with the respective receipt.
The application will also allow the upload of a file (of the type .txt and / or .csv) that shows the Collaborator the transactions carried out and information about the tasks developed, of a given Freelancer.
